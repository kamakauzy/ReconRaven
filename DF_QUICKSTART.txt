DIRECTION FINDING (DF) ARRAY - QUICK START GUIDE
================================================

WHAT'S NEW:
----------
ReconRaven now supports multi-SDR Direction Finding using the MUSIC algorithm!

THE 3D PRINTED V-DIPOLE FITS PERFECTLY:
---------------------------------------
- 120deg V-dipole design provides optimal phase characteristics
- Works across 2m (144-148 MHz) and 70cm (420-450 MHz) bands
- 3D print 4 mounts: https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-120-degree-v-dipole-guide-133341
- Mount on 0.5m square array for best results

HARDWARE NEEDED:
---------------
- 4x RTL-SDR V4 dongles
- 4x V-dipole antennas (3D printed mounts)
- Powered USB hub
- Array frame (PVC/wood, 0.5m spacing)

QUICK SETUP:
-----------
1. Build array frame with 0.5m spacing (square configuration)
2. Mount 4 V-dipole antennas
3. Connect 4 SDRs (label them #0, #1, #2, #3)
4. Plug into powered USB hub

CALIBRATION:
-----------
OPTION 1: With Known Bearing (Most Accurate)
  - Place transmitter 50-100m away at known compass bearing
  - Run: python reconraven.py test df-cal --freq 146.52 --bearing 45
  - Replace 45 with actual bearing in degrees

OPTION 2: Ambient Noise (Convenient)
  - Tune to strong local FM/repeater
  - Run: python reconraven.py test df-cal --freq 146.52

WHAT TO EXPECT:
--------------
Calibration output shows:
  - Phase offsets for each SDR (radians)
  - Coherence score (>0.7 is good, >0.8 excellent)
  - SNR (>10 dB acceptable, >15 dB excellent)

USING DF MODE:
-------------
Once calibrated, start scanning:
  python reconraven.py scan --dashboard

Dashboard will show:
  - Compass with bearing arrows
  - Frequency of detected signals
  - Confidence score for each bearing
  - Recent bearings list

EXPECTED ACCURACY:
-----------------
With proper calibration:
  - Bearing error: +/-5deg typical
  - Range: 360deg azimuth coverage
  - Confidence: 0.7-0.95 for strong signals

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
Low coherence (<0.7)?
  -> Check all RF connections
  -> Ensure antennas are identical
  -> Verify spacing is accurate

Bearings off by ~90deg?
  -> Check array orientation in config/hardware.yaml
  -> Verify element positions

180deg ambiguity?
  -> Use square array instead of linear

FULL DOCUMENTATION:
------------------
See docs/DF_SETUP_GUIDE.md for complete details:
  - Array geometry options
  - Element spacing calculations
  - Calibration methods
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Triangulation techniques

CONFIGURATION:
-------------
Edit config/hardware.yaml to customize:
  - Array geometry (square/circular/linear)
  - Element positions
  - Antenna type
  - Calibration parameters

COMMANDS:
--------
Detect SDRs:        python reconraven.py test sdr
Calibrate array:    python reconraven.py test df-cal --freq 146.52
View calibrations:  python reconraven.py db stats
Start scanning:     python reconraven.py scan --dashboard

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
--------------
$ python reconraven.py test df-cal --freq 146.52 --bearing 45

Detected SDRs: 4
Calibration Frequency: 146.520 MHz
Known Bearing: 45deg

Calibrating at 146.520 MHz...
This will take 10-15 seconds...

CALIBRATION SUCCESSFUL!
Method: Cross-correlation with known bearing 45deg
Coherence: 0.87 (>0.7 is good)
SNR: 23.4 dB

Phase Offsets (radians):
  SDR #0: +0.0000 rad (+0.0deg)   [Reference]
  SDR #1: -0.2341 rad (-13.4deg)
  SDR #2: +0.1532 rad (+8.8deg)
  SDR #3: -0.0921 rad (-5.3deg)

[EXCELLENT] coherence - Array is well synchronized
[STRONG] signal - Calibration very reliable

The array is now calibrated and ready for direction finding!

WHY IT MATTERS:
--------------
With DF capability, you can:
  [OK] Locate rogue transmitters
  [OK] Track drone control links
  [OK] Find interference sources
  [OK] Hunt for specific signals
  [OK] Map RF environment
  [OK] Triangulate signal sources

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Print 4x V-dipole mounts
2. Assemble array frame
3. Run calibration
4. Start scanning with DF enabled
5. Watch bearings appear on dashboard!
